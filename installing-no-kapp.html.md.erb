title: Install Tanzu Build Service without kapp controller

Installing Tanzu Build Service (commonly known as TBS) without kapp controller is no longer supported.

Tanzu Build Service v1.13 tries to stamp out package installs.
<!-- What does this mean? Does it mean this version removes package installs or standardizes them? -->
Lite dependencies are now included with
package installs so Tanzu Build Service now relies on kapp controller for installation.

Older versions of Tanzu Build Service do not have lite dependencies automatically and only works if
you use the automatic dependency updater.
<!-- does this mean you can only install lite deps with the auto deps updater in 1.12 and earlier? -->
