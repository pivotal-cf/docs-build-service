title: Install Tanzu Build Service without kapp controller

This method to install Tanzu Build Service (commonly known as TBS) without kapp controller is no longer supported.

TBS 1.13 tries to stamp out package installs. Lite dependencies have been added to package installs so we now rely on kapp controller for installation.

Older versions of TBS do not have lite deps automatically and only works if you auto deps updater
