Installing Tanzu Build Service (commonly known as TBS) without kapp controller is no longer supported.

Tanzu Build Service v1.13 includes lite dependencies with package installs. Tanzu Build Service now
relies on kapp controller for installation.

Older versions of Tanzu Build Service do not have lite dependencies automatically.
With these versions, you can install lite dependencies if you use the automatic dependency updater.
