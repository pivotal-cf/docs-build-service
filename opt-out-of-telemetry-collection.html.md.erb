# Opt out of telemetry collection

This topic describes how to opt out of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).
By default, when you install Tanzu Build Service, you are opted into telemetry collection.
To turn off telemetry collection, complete following the instructions.

>**Note** If you opt out of telemetry collection, VMware cannot offer you proactive support
and the other benefits that accompany participation in the CEIP.

T turn off telemetry collection on your Tanzu Build Service installation:

1. Ensure your Kubernetes context is pointing to the cluster where Tanzu Application Platform is installed.

2. Run the following `kubectl` command:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: vmware-system-telemetry
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      namespace: vmware-system-telemetry
      name: vmware-telemetry-cluster-ceip
    data:
      level: disabled
    EOF
    ```

3. If you already have Tanzu Build Service installed, restart the telemetry collector to pick up the change:

    ```console
    kubectl delete pods --namespace tap-telemetry --all
    ```

Your Tanzu Build Service deployment no longer emits telemetry, and you are opted out of the CEIP.
