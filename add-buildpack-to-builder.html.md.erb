title: Adding Buildpacks to Builders
owner: Build Service Team

Create a buildpack using [this guide](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/).

As descibed [here](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack/), the output of the buildpack creation is a buildpackage.

# Add a buildpack to a builder

### Add a buildpack to an existing ClusterStore
```
kp clusterstore save <store> -b <buildpackage>
```

### Add a buildpack to a builder
A buildpack can be added either to a new custom builder or to an existing one.

Below described the instructions on how to add the buildpack in each of the options.

#### Create a new custom builder with a buildpack
* Create a cluster stack
```
kp clusterstack save <stack> --build-image paketobuildpacks/build:base-cnb --run-image paketobuildpacks/run:base-cnb
```
* Create a builder
```
kp builder save <builder> --tag <IMAGE-TAG> --stack <stack> --store <store>  --buildpack <buildpackage>
```

#### Change the order in a custom builder
```
kp builder save <builder> -o <order>
```
`<order>` is a yaml file describing the new order. 

If there is only one detection group (with one or multiple buildpacks), there is no need to use an `<order>` file:
```
kp builder save <builder> -b <buildpackage1> -b <buildpackage2>...
```


### Update an image to use the updated builder
`kp image save <image> --builder <builder>`
