This topic describes how to use the `kp` cli with Tanzu Build Service

## <a id='kp-overview'></a> The kp cli

`kp` is a cli that can be used to interact with Tanzu Build Service resources.
In all cases, `kubectl` can be used to interact with TBS â€“ however `kp` simplifies and improves the experience.

The `kp` cli git repository can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/)
Documentation for the `kp` cli can be found [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/tree/main/docs)

Some of the highlights of using the `kp` cli:
- [Configuring secrets for TBS](managing-secrets.html)
- [Getting logs for builds](managing-images.html#build-logs)
- [Creating builders](managing-builders.html)

## <a id='kp-limitations'></a> Limitations of the kp cli

The `kp` cli includes almost all features of TBS. However, not all features are supported. Eventually, we hope to have all
TBS behavior covered in `kp`.

The set of unsupported features that are NOT in `kp` (current version: 0.7.0):

- Custom Stacks
- Images
  - `successBuildHistoryLimit` and `failedBuildHistoryLimit`
  - `imageTaggingStrategy`
  - `defaultProcess`
  - `cache.registry`
  - `cache.volume.storageClassName`
  - `cosign`
