# <a id='images'></a> Image Resources

Image resources provide a configuration for Tanzu Build Service to build and maintain a Docker image utilizing Tanzu, Paketo, and custom [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io).

Build Service monitors the inputs to the image resource to rebuild the image when the underlying source or buildpacks have changed.

The following procedures describe how to create and manage image resources in Build Service with the `kp` CLI.

## <a id='create-image'></a> Creating Image Resources

Prerequisites:

* [Access to a cluster](accessing-tbs.html) running Build Service.
* Configured write [secrets](managing-secrets.html) for your Docker registry.

#### Source Code

The `kp` CLI supports creating Image Resources using source code from the following locations:

* [Git based source](#create-image-with-git-repo)
* [Blob store](#create-image-by-referencing-blob-store-source)
* [Local machine](#create-image-with-local-source-code)

You can specify only one location for app source code.

#### Builders

Users can select a Builder (namespaced-scoped) or a Cluster Builder (cluster-scoped) used to create image resource builds. You can use any of the available Builders or Cluster Builders with any of the source types (git, blob, or local).

If you do not use the `--builder` or `--cluster-builder` flags, the `default` Cluster Builder is used.

For more information on Builders, see [Managing Builders](managing-builders.html).

### <a id='create-image-with-git-repo'></a> Creating an image resource with source code in a Git repository

To create an image resource using source code from a git repository, run:

    kp image create <name> \
      --tag <tag> \
      [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
      --namespace <namespace> \
      --env <env> \
      --sub-path <sub-path> \
      --wait \
      --git <git-repo> \
      --git-revision <git-revision>

Where:

* `name` is the name of the image resource.
* `tag` is the registry location where the image is created.
* `builder` (optional) is the builder name used in the image resource. Cannot be used with `cluster-builder`.
* `cluster-builder` (optional) is the Cluster Builder name to be used in the image resource. Defaults to `default` when `builder` is not set. Cannot be used with `builder`.
* `namespace` (optional) is the Kubernetes namespace for the image resource. Defaults to the local Kubernetes current-context namespace.
* `env` (optional) is the image resource environment variable configuration as key=val pairs (`env_var=env_val`). The `--env` flag can be specified multiple times.
* `sub-path` (optional) is the build code at the subpath located within the source code directory.
* `cache-size` (optional) is the cache size used for subsequent builds. Must be a valid kubernetes quantity (default 2G).
* `wait` flag (optional) waits for image create to be reconciled and tails resulting build logs.
* `git-repo` is the Git repository URL of the source code.
* `git-revision` (optional) is the Git revision of the code that the image is built against. Can be either a `branch`, `tag` or a commit `sha`. When you target the image resource against a branch, Build Service triggers a build for every new commit. Defaults to `master`.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If the <code>git-repo</code> is a private repository, you must configure the Git credentials. For more information, see <a href="managing-secrets.html#creating-secrets">Create Secrets</a>.</p>

### <a id='create-image-by-referencing-blob-store-source'></a> Create an image resource with source code in a blob store

Users can specify source code in a blob store saved as a compressed file (`zip`, `tar.gz`, `.tar`) or a `.jar` file.

To create an image resource using source code from blob store:

	kp image create <name> \
	  --tag <tag> \
	  [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
	  --namespace <namespace> \
	  --env <env> \
	  --sub-path <sub-path> \
	  --wait \
	  --blob <blob-url>

Where:

* `name` is the name of the image resource.
* `tag` is the registry location where the image is created.
* `builder` (optional) is the builder name used in the image resource. Cannot be used with `cluster-builder`.
* `cluster-builder` (optional) is the Cluster Builder name to be used in the image resource. Defaults to `default` when `builder` is not set. Cannot be used with `builder`.
* `namespace` (optional) is the Kubernetes namespace for the image resource. Defaults to the local Kubernetes current-context namespace.
* `env` (optional) is the image resource environment variable configuration as key=val pairs (`env_var=env_val`). The `--env` flag can be specified multiple times.
* `sub-path` (optional) is the build code at the subpath located within the source code directory.
* `cache-size` (optional) is the cache size used for subsequent builds. Must be a valid kubernetes quantity (default 2G).
* `wait` flag (optional) waits for image create to be reconciled and tails resulting build logs.
* `blob-url` is the URL of the source code blob file.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The source code file in the blob store must be publicly viewable or the <code>blob-url</code> must contain the basic authentication credentials.</p>

### <a id='create-image-with-local-source-code'></a> Creating an image resource with local source code

Users can apply local source code from a directory, compressed source code (`zip`, `tar.gz`, `.tar`), or a `.jar` file.

To create an image resource using source code from a local machine, run:

	kp image create <name> \
	  --tag <tag> \
	  --local-path <source-path> \
	  [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
	  --namespace <namespace> \
	  --env <env> \
	  --cache \
	  --registry-ca-cert-path <path-to-ca-cert> \
	  --registry-verify-certs

Where:

* `name` is the name of the image resource.
* `tag` is the registry location where the image is created.
* `source-path` is the path to local source code.
* `builder` (optional) is the builder name used in the image resource. Cannot be used with `cluster-builder`.
* `cluster-builder` (optional) is the Cluster Builder name used in the image resource. Defaults to `default` when `builder` is not set. Cannot be used with `builder`.
* `namespace` (optional) is the Kubernetes namespace for the image resource. Defaults to the local Kubernetes current-context namespace.
* `env` (optional) is the image resource environment variable configuration as key=val pairs (`env_var=env_val`). The `--env` flag can be specified multiple times.
* `cache-size` (optional) is the cache size used for subsequent builds. Must be a valid kubernetes quantity (default 2G).
* `--wait` flag (optional) waits for image create to be reconciled and tails resulting build logs.
* `registry-ca-cert-path` (optional) adds CA certificate for registry API.
* `registry-verify-certs` (optional) sets whether to verify server's certificate chain and host name (default true).

### <a id='buildpack-config'></a> Buildpack configuration

Image resources use buildpacks to build application images in a registry. The buildpacks contain the dependencies needed for these builds and you can add buildpack configuration to Tanzu Build Service image resources.

#### <a id='buildpack-config-use-cases'></a> Buildpack configuration use cases

Common use cases for setting buildpack configuration include:

* Selecting a specific version or version line of a dependency (Go 1.15.*, Java 1.8)
* Language-specific configuration (Go build target)
* Buildpack-specific configuration

#### <a id='buildpack-config-docs'></a> Buildpack configuration documentation

Buildpack configuration details can be found in the documentation for that specific buildpack.

Use `kp clusterstore status <store-name> --verbose` to find the homepage of the desired buildpack.

#### <a id='buildpack-config-use-cases'></a> Buildpack configuration in image resources

Buildpack configuration, including manually selecting buildpacks to use, can be set in two ways in Tanzu Build Service Image Resources. The configuration depends on the specific buildpack, find buildpack details in [Buildpack Configuration Documentation](#buildpack-config-docs).

1. Creating a `buildpack.yml` file at the root of the application source code.

Example `buildpack.yml` for a Go app to use the latest Go 1.15 version and build with the path `./cmd/package`:

```
go:
  version: 1.15.*
  targets: ["./cmd/package"]
```

2. Setting environment variables on an image resource.

Tanzu Build Service image resources can have environment variables configured that are set in all Builds and in the final exported registry image. These can be used for buildpack configuration.

Example `kp` command to create an image resource for a Go app to build with the path `./cmd/package`:

```
kp image create my-image \
  --tag registry.io/my-repo \
  --git https://github.com/my-go-app \
  --env BP_GO_TARGETS="./cmd/package"
```

## <a id='patch-images'></a> Patching image resources

Users can patch their existing image resources with the `kp` CLI. Running a patch triggers a new build of the image resource if any of the build inputs are changed.

Patch image resources with the following commands:

* With source code in a Git repository

	```
    kp image patch <name> \
	  [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
	  --namespace <namespace> \
	  --env <env> \
	  --wait \
	  --git <git-repo> \
	  --git-revision <git-revision>
    ```

* With source code in a blob store

	```
    kp image patch <name> \
	  [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
	  --namespace <namespace> \
	  --env <env> \
	  --wait \
	  --blob <blob-url>
    ```

* With local source code

	```
    kp image patch <name> \
	  [--builder <builder> or --cluster-builder <cluster-builder>] \
	  --namespace <namespace> \
	  --env <env> \
	  --wait \
	  --local-path <source-path>
    ```

Where:

* `name` is the name of the image resource to patch.
* `namespace` (optional) is the Kubernetes namespace for the image resource. Defaults to the local Kubernetes current-context namespace.
* `env` (optional) is the image resource environment variable configuration as key=val pairs (`env_var=env_val`). The `--env` flag can be specified multiple times.
* `cache-size` (optional) is the cache size used for subsequent builds. Must be a valid Kubernetes quantity (default 2G).
* `git-repo` is the Git repository URL of the source code. Must select one of `git-repo`, `blob-url`, or `source-path`
* `git-revision` (optional) is the Git revision of the code that the image is built against. Can be either a `branch`, `tag` or a commit `sha`. When you target the image resource against a branch, Build Service triggers a build for every new commit. Defaults to `master`.
* `blob-url` is the URL of the source code blob file. Must select one of `git-repo`, `blob-url`, or `source-path`
* `source-path` is the path to local source code. Must select one of `git-repo`, `blob-url`, or `source-path`

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If the <code>git-repo</code> is a private repository, you must configure the Git credentials. For more information, see <a href="managing-secrets.html#creating-secrets">Create Secrets</a>.</p>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>tag</code> location in a registry and <code>name</code> of an image resource cannot be modified. To change these fields, you must create a new image resource.</p>

## <a id='save-image'></a> Saving image resources

Users can create or patch an image resource using the `save` command. The `kp image save` command is used exactly the same as `kp image create` or `kp image patch`, but it determines whether an image resource needs to be created or patched.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>For handling source code changes in the Tanzu Build Service process, VMware recommends utilizing the `kp image save --wait` command within a CI/CD pipeline to update the source code referenced in the image resource.</p>
You can do this by updating the `--git-revision` field with a new commit ID.  This commit ID references source code that has undergone unit testing, so the resulting image can be deployed or promoted to higher level environments.

```
kp image save my-image \
  --tag my-registry.com/my-repo \
  --git https://my-repo.com/my-app.git \
  --git-revision my-branch
```

## <a id='list-images'></a> Listing images

To list all the image resources in a Kubernetes namespace:

    kp image list --namespace <namespace>

For example:

```
$ kp image list -n example1

NAME            READY     LATEST REASON    LATEST IMAGE         NAMESPACE
test-image1     True      CONFIG           first/image:sha      example1
test-image2     False     BUILDPACK        second/image:sha     example1
```

To list all the image resources across all Kubernetes namespaces:

    kp image list --all-namespaces

For example:

```
$ kp image list -A

NAME            READY     LATEST REASON    LATEST IMAGE         NAMESPACE
test-image1     True      CONFIG           first/image:sha      example1
test-image2     True      BUILDPACK        second/image:sha     example1
test-image3     True      BUILDPACK        third/image:sha      example2
test-image4     False     CONFIG           fourth/image:sha     example2
```

### <a id='filter-images'></a> Filter image resources

Users can further filter the list of image resources by applying the `--filter` flag and specifying a filter and value. This command is useful for traversing large number of image resources by narrowing the list to only display image resources that possess certain attributes.

```
$ kp image list --filter ready=false -A

NAME            READY     LATEST REASON    LATEST IMAGE         NAMESPACE
test-image2     False     BUILDPACK        second/image:sha     example1
test-image4     False     CONFIG           fourth/image:sha     example2
```

See below for the currently supported filters and values:

```
builder=string
clusterbuilder=string
latest-reason=commit,trigger,config,stack,buildpack
ready=true,false,unknown
```

## <a id='rebuild-image'></a> Image resource rebuilds

Rebuilds happen in three ways:

1. An imperative rebuild occurs when you patch an image resource with `kp image patch`.
1. An automatic rebuild occurs when build inputs change (source code, stack, or buildpacks).
1. A user can trigger a rebuild manually.

An imperative rebuild is initiated if any of the following changes are made to an image resource:

* An update to the commit, branch, Git repository, or other arguments to `kp image patch`.

* You upload a new copy of the local source code by running `kp image patch --local-path <source-path>`, where `<source-path>` is the source code path.

For more information, see [Patching image resources](#patch-images).

Build Service auto-rebuilds image resources when one or more of the following build inputs change:

* New buildpack versions are made available through updates to a Cluster Store.
    - New Buildpack versions are made available on [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/).
    - To update buildpacks, you must add new buildpack versions from Tanzu Network to a Cluster Store. See [Updating Build Service Dependencies](updating-deps.html) for more details.

* There is a new commit on a branch or tag Tanzu Build Service is tracking.

* There is a new Cluster Stack (that is, base OS image) available, such as `full`, `tiny`, or `base`.
	- New Stack versions are made available on the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tbs-dependencies) page on Tanzu Network.
    - You can get updates to Stacks from the Tanzu Network Registry by using the `kp` CLI. See [Updating Build Service Dependencies](updating-deps.html) for more details.

### <a id='trigger-rebuild-image'></a> Trigger an image resource rebuild

You can initiate a manual rebuild using `kp`:

    kp image trigger <image-name> --namespace <namespace>

This is useful for debugging image resource builds.

## <a id='view-image-status'></a> Viewing the status of an image resource

When a user creates an image resource using the above workflow, they are configuring Tanzu Build Service to start creating builds of the image resource that create container images to be pushed to a registry.

If a particular build associated with an image resource fails, check the status of the image resource by running:

    kp image status <image-name> --namespace <namespace>

Where `image-name` is the name of the image resource. See [Listing image resources](#list-images) to get image names.

The following is an example output of this command:

```
Status:          Not Ready
Message:         --
LatestImage:     gcr.io/myapp@sha256:9d7b1fbf7f5cb0f8efe797f30e598b5e38bb1c08ada143d4c96e4f78111a9239

Last Successful Build
Id:        1
Reason:    CONFIG

Last Failed Build
Id:        2
Reason:    COMMIT
```

## <a id='delete-images'></a> Deleting an image resource

This procedure describes how to delete a Build Service image resource with the `kp` CLI.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Deleting an image resource deletes the image resource and all the builds that the image resource owns. It does not delete the app images generated by those builds from the registry.</p>

To delete an image resource:

    kp image delete <image> --namespace <namespace>

Where `image` is the name of the image resource.

When you successfully delete an image resource, you see this message:

```
"<image>" deleted
```

## <a id='image-with-YAML'></a> Managing image resources with YAML

Build Services image resources can be created by applying the [kpack image resources](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/master/docs/image.md) to cluster through `kubectl`.

Use the `default` service account for Build Service registry and Git secrets.

### <a id='additional-tags'></a> Image resource additional tags

With the addition of kpack apiVersion kpack.io/v1alpha2, additional tags can be specified on image resources. Additional tags are not currently configurable through the `kp` cli, applying YAML configuration with `kubectl` is required. See [kpack docs](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/image.md#tags-config) for details.

### <a id='registry-cache'></a> Using a registry for caching

Tanzu Build Service image resource can be configured to use a registry as the build cache instead of a persistent volume. Currently, configuring the registry cache is not supported with kp and kubectl must be used.

For more details, see the kpack [image config](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/image.md) docs for how to set the cache tag.

#### <a id='kubectl-secrets'></a> Using secrets

Use the `default` service account for Build Service registry and Git secrets. kpack will default to the `default` service account if no service account is specified.

#### <a id='image-status'></a> Debugging with image resource status

Using `kubectl` is a good way to debug image resources.

When an image resource has successfully built with its current configuration, its status reports the up-to-date fully qualified built image reference.

This information is available with `kubectl get image <image-name> -o yaml`.

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:16:36Z"
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:16:36Z"
    status: "True"
    type: BuilderReady
  latestImage: index.docker.io/sample/image@sha256:d3eb15a6fd25cb79039594294419de2328f14b443fa0546fa9e16f5214d61686
  ...
```

When a build fails, the image resource status reports the condition Succeeded=False. The image resource status also includes the status of the
builder used by the image resource. If the builder is not ready, you may want to inspect that builder. More details in [Managing Builders](managing-builders.html).

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:13:48Z"
    status: "False"
    type: Succeeded
    message: "Some error occurred"
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:16:36Z"
  	status: "False"
  	type: BuilderReady
  	message: "Some builder error occurred"
  ...
```

If further debugging is required, inspect the image resource's latest Build status discussed in [Viewing Build Details for an Image Resource](#build-status).

## <a id='service-bindings'></a> Image resource service bindings

Tanzu Build Service supports application service bindings as described in the Kubernetes [Service Bindings specification](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec).

The `kp` CLI does not currently support creating service bindings, you should use `kubectl`.

### <a id='service-bindings'></a> Creating an image resource with service bindings

For more information, see [Service Bindings](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/servicebindings.md) in the kpack documentation on GitHub.

To create a service binding in your application image, you must create *either* of the following:

* A [Provisioned service](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec#provisioned-service)
* A Kubernetes secret that follows the guidelines provided in [Well-known Secret Entry](https://github.com/servicebinding/spec#provisioned-service)

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Check the desired buildpack documentation for details on the service bindings it supports. You can access these docs on [Language Family Buildpacks for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-index.html).</p>

The following is an example you can use with `kubectl apply`. It creates a `production-db` service binding for a maven app.

Example:

```
apiVersion: kpack.io/v1alpha2
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: sample-binding-with-secret
spec:
  tag: my-registry.com/repo
  builder:
    kind: ClusterBuilder
    name: default
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
      revision: 0eccc6c2f01d9f055087ebbf03526ed0623e014a
  build:
    services:
    - name: production-db-secret
      kind: Secret
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: production-db-secret
type: servicebinding.io/mysql
stringData:
  type: mysql
  provider: bitnami
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  username: root
  password: root
```

# <a id='builds'></a> Builds

The procedures in this section describe how to view information and logs for image resource builds using the `kp` CLI.

## <a id='list-builds'></a> Listing builds

Build Service stores the ten most recent successful builds and the ten most recent failed builds.

To see a the list of builds for an image resource, run:

	kp build list <image-name> --namespace <namespace>

If the `namespace` is not specified, it defaults to the Kubernetes current-context namespace. If the `image-name` is not specified, the builds for all the image resources in your namespace are listed.

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
BUILD    STATUS    IMAGE                           REASON
1        SUCCESS   gcr.io/myapp@sha256:some-sha1   CONFIG
2        SUCCESS   gcr.io/myapp@sha256:some-sha2   COMMIT
3        SUCCESS   gcr.io/myapp@sha256:some-sha3   STACK
4        FAILURE   gcr.io/myapp@sha256:some-sha4   CONFIG+
5        BUILDING  gcr.io/myapp@sha256:some-sha5   BUILDPACK
```

The following describes the fields in the example output:

* `BUILD` describes the index of builds in the order they were built.

* `STATUS` describes the status of a previous build image.

* `IMAGE` is the full image reference for the app image produced by the build.

* `REASON` describes why an image rebuild occurred. These reasons include:
    * `CONFIG`: Occurs when a change is made to commit, branch, Git repository, or build fields on the image's configuration file and you run `kp image apply`.
    * `COMMIT`: Occurs when new source code is committed to a branch or tag that Build Service is monitoring for changes.
    * `BUILDPACK`: Occurs when new buildpack versions are made available through an updated builder.
    * `STACK`: Occurs when a new base OS image, called a `run image`, is available.
    * `TRIGGER`: Occurs when a new build is manually triggered.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A rebuild can occur for more than one reason. When there are multiple reasons for a rebuild, the <code>kp</code> CLI output shows the primary <code>Reason</code> and appends a <code>+</code> sign to the <code>Reason</code> field. The priority rank for the <code>Reason</code>, from highest to lowest, is <code>CONFIG</code>, <code>COMMIT</code>, <code>BUILDPACK</code>, <code>STACK</code>, and <code>TRIGGER</code>.</p>

## <a id='build-status'></a> Viewing build details for an image

To display retrieve a detailed bill of materials for a particular build:

    kp build status <image> -b <build-number>

Where:

* `image-name` is the name of the image resource the build is associated with
* `build-name` (optional) is the index of the build from [listing builds](#list-builds). Defaults to latest build.

The following is an example of the output for this command:

```
Image:      gcr.io/myapp@sha256:f87b614257af05c3301c1554c4f15131793caec3adf55e45d2c612e90445765a

If you see this error and you are using a Cluster Builder, you might need to configure a Synced Secret. See [When to use Synchronized Secrets](synced-secrets.html#sync-secrets).

## <a id='build-logs'></a> Getting build logs

An image resource that a user creates causes builds to be initiated for that image. Builds are where Cloud Native Buildpacks are run and apps get built into images.

Build logs are a good way to debug issues and to get information about how your app is being built.

If you get logs of a build in progress, the logs are tailed and terminate when the build completes.

To get logs from a build run:

	kp build logs <image> --build <build-number> --namespace <namespace>

Where:

* `image-name` is the name of the image resource the build is associated with.
* `build-name` (optional) is the index of the build from [listing builds](#list-builds). Defaults to latest build.

The following is an example of the output of the command:

## <a id='build-status'></a> Viewing bill of materials

The kp cli allows you to view the bill of materials in an image built by a Build.

```
kp build status <image-name> --bom
```

To generate the bill of materials, the kp CLI reads metadata from the image (generated by the build) in the registry.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must have credentials to access the image registry on your machine.</p>

For example:

```
$ kp build status --bom my-app-image | jq
[
  {
    "buildpack": {
      "id": "tanzu-buildpacks/node-engine",
      "version": "0.1.2"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "licenses": [],
      "name": "Node Engine",
      "sha256": "b981046a0ea3d5594a7f04fae3afdfa1983bc65f4e26e768b38a2d67057ac75c",
      "stacks": [

      "version": "0.1.1"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "launch": true
    },

  }
]
```

## <a id='offline-builds'></a> Offline builds

Tanzu Build Service supports offline/air-gapped builds with Tanzu Buildpacks. Offline builds use pre-packaged dependencies and do not need to download from anywhere off-cluster to create application images.

When using Tanzu Buildpacks the build will execute as an offline build. For details on how to configure buildpacks, see [Buildpack configuration in images](#buildpack-config-use-cases).

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Offline builds only ensure buildpack dependencies are offline. The application build and custom configuration must also not reach off-cluster to be completely offline.</p>

## <a id='cosign'></a> Image signing with cosign

Tanzu Build Service supports [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) image signing.

Images signed with cosign require using `kubectl` instead of `kp`.

#### Cosign signing secret

Images can be signed with cosign when a cosign formatted secret is added to the service account used to build the image.
The secret can be added using the cosign CLI or manually.

To create a cosign signing secret through the cosign CLI, when targetted to the Kubernetes cluster, use:

`cosign generate-key-pair k8s://[NAMESPACE]/[NAME]`

Alternatively, create the cosign secret and provide your own cosign key files manually to Kubernetes by running the following command:

```shell script
% kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=cosign.password=<password> --from-file=</path/to/cosign.key>
```

- `<secret-name>` is the name of the secret. Ensure that the secret is created in the same namespace as the eventual image resource.
- `<password>` is the password provided to encrypt the private key. If not present, an empty password will be used.
- `</path/to/cosign.key>` is the cosign private key file generated with `cosign generate-key-pair`.

After adding the cosign secret, the secret must be added to the list of `secrets` attached to the service account resource that is building the image.

#### Adding cosign annotations

By default, the build number and build timestamp information ise added to the cosign signing annotations. Users can specify additional cosign annotations under the spec key.

```yaml
cosign:
  annotations:
  - name: "annotationName"
    value: "annotationValue"
```

One way these annotations can be viewed is through verifying cosign signatures. The annotations are under the `optional` key in the verified JSON response. For example, you can do this by running:

```bash
% cosign verify -key /path/to/cosign.pub registry.example.com/project/image@sha256:<DIGEST>
```

Which provides a JSON response similar to:

```json
{
  "critical": {
    "identity": {
      "docker-reference": "registry.example.com/project/image"
    }, "image": {
      "docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:<DIGEST>"
    }, "type": "cosign container image signature"
  }, "optional": {
    "buildNumber": "1",
    "buildTimestamp": "20210827.175240",
    "annotationName": "annotationValue"
  }
}
```

#### Push cosign signature to a different location

Cosign signatures can be pushed to a different registry from where the image is located. To enable this, add the corresponding annotation to the cosign secret resource:

```
metadata:
  name: ...
  namespace: ...
  annotations:
    kpack.io/cosign.repository: other.registry.com/project/image
data:
  cosign.key: ...
  cosign.password: ...
```

This is equivalent to setting `COSIGN_REPOSITORY` as specified in cosign [Specifying Registry](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#specifying-registry) on GitHub.

The same service account that has that cosign secret attached, and is used for signing and building the image, requires that the registry credentials for this other repository be placed under the listed `secrets`. It is not required to be listed in `imagePullSecrets`. To push the signatures to the same registry but to a different path from the image, the credential used must have access to both paths. You cannot use two separate credentials for the same registry with different paths.

#### Cosign legacy Docker media types

To sign images in a registry that does not fully support OCI media types, you can use legacy equivalents by adding the corresponding annotation to the cosign secret resource:

```
metadata:
  name: ...
  namespace: ...
  annotations:
    kpack.io/cosign.docker-media-types: "1"
data:
  cosign.key: ...
  cosign.password: ...
```

This is equivalent to setting `COSIGN_DOCKER_MEDIA_TYPES=1` as specified in the cosign [registry-support](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support).
