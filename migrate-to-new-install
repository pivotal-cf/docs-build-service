This topic describes how to migrate kapp or kapp-controller installations of Tanzu Build Service to a [profile-based installation](installing-tap-profile.html) of Tanzu Build Service

## <a id='kapp-contoller-migration'></a> Migrating from kapp controller installation to TAP profile installation

**Note:** This assumes that the Tanzu Build Service kapp controller install was deployed in the `tbs-install` namespace with the name `tbs` (this is what our kapp controller installation documentation instructs) and the new instllation of Tanzu Build Service will be installed in the `tap-install` namespace.


1. `kubectl -n tbs-install patch packageinstalls.packaging.carvel.dev tbs --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/noopDelete", "value":true}]'`
2. `tanzu package installed delete tbs -n tbs-install`
3. Verify tbs is still installed with `kubectl get clusterbuilders` 
4. `tanzu package repository delete tbs-repository -n tbs-install`
5. `kubectl create ns tap-install`
6. `kapp rename -a tbs.app -n tbs-install new-name buildservice.app --new-namespace tap-install`
7. Follow new Tanzu Build Service [installation via `buildservice` profile](installing-tap-profile.html) workflow

## <a id='kapp-migration'></a> Migrating from kapp installation to TAP profile installation

**Note:** this assumes that the kapp app was deployed with the name `tanzu-build-service` in the `default` namespace (this is what our kapp installation documentation instructs) and the new installation of Tanzu Build Service will be installed in the `tap-install` namespace. 

1. `kubectl create ns tap-install`
2. `kapp rename -a tanzu-build-service --new-name buildservice.app --new-namespace tap-install`
3. Follow new Tanzu Build Service [installation via `buildservice` profile](installing-tap-profile.html) workflow
