## <a id="1-11-10"></a> v1.11.10

**Release Date: July 27th, 2023**

### Breaking changes
- Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) Stacks and ClusterBuilders are no longer shipped wiht TBS.

### Known Issues
- When installing TBS through [Tanzu Application Platform profiles](installing-tap-profile.html),
  the automatic dependency updater will fail to get created for TAP versions
  v1.6.1 and v1.6.2. This will result in dependencies like buildpacks and
  stacks not getting automatically updated from TanzuNetwork. A hotfix has been
  released and can be [installed here](installing-tap-profile.html#deps-updater-hotfix).

### New Features
- Introduced new (Cluster)Buildpack Resource to improve visibility and control of Buildpacks on the cluster
- (Cluster)Builders can leverage the new Buildpack resource. The Store key on the Builder is now optional if you just want to use the Buildpack resource.
- Git implementation migarted back to go-git for increased performance and reliabilty
- Improved error messages on all resources to help troubleshoot issues
- Bump Cosign integration to v2

### Bug fixes
- (Cluster)Builder layers are now deduplicated
