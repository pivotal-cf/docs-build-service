## <a id="1-7-2"></a> v1.7.2

**Release Date: October 21, 2022**

### New Features

- **Support for installing on Openshift after a standard install:** Previously, installing on Openshift
resulted in `seccomp` errors and required additional installation steps.

- **Support for the [Ubuntu Jammy](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) stack:** You can find
Jammy stacks on [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/).
Automatic dependency updates automatically install Jammy stacks.

### Deprecated Features

- **Ubuntu Bionic stacks are deprecated:** The Ubuntu Bionic release is [removing support in April 2023](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
Migrate apps to the Jammy stack before this date.

- **The legacy Cloud Native Buildpack Bill of Materials (CNB BOM) format is deprecated:**
However, it is still activated by default in Tanzu Build Service. You can deactivate support manually
by passing `--data-value-yaml include_legacy_bom=false` to `ytt` when processing the Tanzu Build Service
bundle or by adding `include_legacy_bom=false` to your `tbs-values.yml` file.
