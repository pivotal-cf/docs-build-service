This topic describes the changes in Tanzu Build Service (commonly known as TBS).

## <a id="1-10-11"></a> v1.10.11

**Release Date: August 15th, 2023**

### Known Issues
- When installing Tanzu Build Service [as a TAP profile](installing-tap-profile.html),
  the installation will fail if automatic dependency updater is configured with a kubernetes secret
  ref. That is, if `buildservice.tanzunet_secret.name` and `buildservice.tanzunet_secret.name` are
  set in `tap-values.yaml`. For a workaround, use plaintext secrets by setting
  `buildservice.tanzunet_username` and `buildservice.tanzunet_password` in `tap-values.yaml`. See
  the [profile install docs](installing-tap-profile.html#tap-values) for more information.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue where some buildpacks caused the builder image to become
  excessively large
