## <a id="1-5-1"></a> v1.5.1

**Release Date: April 25, 2022**

### New Features
- kp cli 0.5.0 has been released which uses the v1alpha2 api version when reading or writing kpack resources
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with prior TBS releases
  - Using --output flag results in v1alpha2 resources which can be applied directly to the cluster without modification
  - Support for --additional-tags flag on `image` commands
  - kp will default to the kp config default service account when operating on cluster-wide resources that use service account refs.
  - All commands that modify existing resources now use http PATCH operation instead of PUT to mitigate unexpected behavior
  - All `upddate` commands have been renamed to `patch` while maintaining `update` as an alias
    - `kp clusterstack update` -> `kp clusterstack patch`
    - `kp lifecycle update` -> `kp lifecycle patch`
- Support installing TBS with secret references instead of plain-text credentials. See [installing docs](installing.html).

### Breaking Changes

- The `canonical-registry-serviceaccount` has been renamed to `kp-default-repository-serviceaccount`
  - Any user-created `Builder` or `ClusterBuilder` resources using `canonical-registry-serviceaccount` should change it to `kp-default-repository-serviceaccount` before upgrading to ensure seamless upgrade.

### Bug Fixes

- Remove perpetually growing kapp controller ConfigMap diffs on AKS
