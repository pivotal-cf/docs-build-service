## <a id="1-12-3"></a> v1.12.3

**Release Date: November 7, 2023**

### Breaking changes
- Minimum supported CNB Platform API is now 0.7. The Platform API is the interface between kpack and the CNB lifecycle.
  This only affects users that have not updated the lifecycle image in the last 2 years. If you encounter this issue, update the lifecycle image.

### New Features
- Images are now signed before metadata is pulled. This is to support registries where unsigned image pulls are disabled.
- Improved build process visibility by propagating statues from sub-components.
    - Image resources now show Build status if a build is running.
    - Image resources now show Builder status if the builder isn't ready.
    - Builds now log if no registry credentials are loaded from the service account.
    - Build resources now show pod status if the generated pod is invalid.
- Improved kpack CLI output
    - Added `--replace-additional-tag` flag to image patch/save commands. This behaves like deleting existing
    `additionalTags` before setting it.
    - Added `--local-path-destination-image` to better control the location of the source code when using the local path
    flow.
    - Added `--success-build-history-limit` and `failed-build-history-limit` flags to the image commands.
    - The `--store` flag is now optional for clusterbuilder and builder commands (builders may use only the Buildpack
    - `kp build log` now displays timestamps.
    - `kp build list` now supports a `--all-namespaces` flag.
      resource)
    - `kp secret` commands now take into consideration if the service account exists.
- Improved the cert-injection-webhook memory usage when handling clusters with large amounts of pods.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed Git failing to clone from Azure DevOps Git repositories.
- Fixed Tanzu Buil Service not being able to use signing keys generated by the latest version of Cosign.
