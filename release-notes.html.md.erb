## <a id="1-4-3"></a> v1.4.3

**Release Date: March, 04, 2022**

### New Features

- Bump kpack to use lifecycle 0.13.3 which adds support for bom entries in the `io.buildpacks.build.metadata` image label in Buildpack API 0.7 in addition to the existing sbom layer formats which establishes a migration path.
- When dependency updates are paused, the pinned descriptor version is [100.0.267](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies#/releases/1053790)

### Breaking Changes

None

### Bug Fixes

- Full windows functionality has been restored
- The [restricted pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) is now applied to all build pods which could previously violate security policies
- When deploying with kapp controller, the deployment will no longer reconcile diffs indefinitely
- Certs are now correctly verified by the TanzuNetDependencyUpdater when using a private registry

### Product Snapshot

Tanzu Build Service 1.4.3 ships with the following components:

* [kpack 0.5.1](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/releases/tag/v0.5.1)
* [kpack cli v0.4.2](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/releases/tag/v0.4.2)
* [CNB lifecycle v0.13.3](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.13.3)

Tanzu Build Service supports and utilizes [Tanzu Buildpacks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/index.html).

### Security Scanning

This section provides context for the CVEs that may show up in security scans of TBS

- github.com/containerd/containerd | [CVE-2021-43816](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2021/cve-2021-43816/) | CRITICAL
    - Containerd is not used as a container runtime in TBS code and therefore never interacts with volume mounts at all

- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2021-44228) | CRITICAL
- org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) | HIGH
    - These CVEs have been patched, however show up in some scans of TBS dependencies such as builders or the Java & Node.js buildpacks. Scanners report these up because some log4j files provided by third-party vendors have been patched but have maintained the same file name which the scanners assume are vulnerable.

### Product Dependencies

Build Service can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster (v1.19 or later).

### Upgrade Path

v1.3.* can be upgraded to v1.4.*. Please follow the [install](installing.html) process to upgrade.


## <a id="1-4-2"></a> v1.4.2

**Release Date: January, 11, 2022**

This release includes a few notable new features:

- TBS can now import a "full" or "lite" descriptor which will use different sets of buildpacks for different use cases. See [intallation](installing.html) for more details.
- The mechanism to sync secrets to build namespaces has changed. Users should now leverage the Carvel secretgen-controller for copying secrets to build namespaces. See the [Secret Synchronization page](synced-secrets.html) for more defails.

### Breaking Changes

- Installation steps have changed slightly. Some flags have changed and you must specify a descriptor name as part of installation. See [intallation](installing.html) for more details.
- Secrets copied to Build namespaces using the old secret-syncing mechanism will be cleaned up. Only copies of secrets will be deleted, original secrets with the `com.vmware.tanzu.buildservice.sync: "true"` label will not be deleted.


### Bug Fixes

- Fix http(s) proxy support with git using HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY env vars
