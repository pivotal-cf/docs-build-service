with kubernetes version >= 1.24

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug that prevented the lifecycle image from getting updated with Tanzu Build Service releases
- Bumped Java Buildpacks
- Bumped Stacks

### Product Snapshot

Tanzu Build Service v1.7.7 ships with the following components:

- [kpack v0.7.5](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/releases/tag/v0.7.5)
- [kpack cli v0.7.1](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/releases/tag/v0.7.1)
- [CNB lifecycle v0.14.3](https://github.com/buildpacks/lifecycle/releases/tag/v0.14.3)

Tanzu Build Service supports and uses [Tanzu Buildpacks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/index.html).

## <a id="1-7-2"></a> v1.7.2

**Release Date: October 21, 2022**

### New Features

- **Support for installing on Openshift after a standard install:** Previously, installing on Openshift
resulted in `seccomp` errors and required additional installation steps.

- **Support for the [Ubuntu Jammy](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) stack:** You can find
Jammy stacks on [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/).
Automatic dependency updates automatically install Jammy stacks.

### Deprecated Features

- **Ubuntu Bionic stacks are deprecated:** The Ubuntu Bionic release is [removing support in April 2023](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
Migrate apps to Jammy stacks before this date.

- **The legacy Cloud Native Buildpack Bill of Materials (CNB BOM) format is deprecated:**
However, it is still activated by default in Tanzu Build Service. You can deactivate support manually
by passing `--data-value-yaml include_legacy_bom=false` to `ytt` when processing the Tanzu Build Service
bundle or by adding `include_legacy_bom=false` to your `tbs-values.yml` file.

### Product Snapshot

Tanzu Build Service v1.7.2 ships with the following components:

- [kpack v0.7.1](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

Tanzu Build Service supports and uses [Tanzu Buildpacks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/index.html).

### Security Scanning

There are some HIGH and CRITICAL CVEs that might show up in scans of this Tanzu Build Service release.
However, none of the CVEs are exploitable.

Below is a list of CVEs that may show up in scans and justification for why they are not exploitable:

| Status | CVE ID | Severity | Dependency | Source | Version | Reason Not Affected |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Not Affected | CVE-2022-42003      | High      |    jackson-databind               | java functions buildpack | 2.13.3 | The configuration `UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` is not used for deserializing data. |
| Not Affected | CVE-2022-42004      | High      |    jackson-databind               | java functions buildpack | 2.13.3 | The only configuration specified by `spring-boot-starter` is `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES`, which only affects whether it continues parsing or not. The CVE requires specific deserializer configurations that Tanzu Build Service does not use. |
| Not Affected | GHSA-jjjh-jjxp-wpff | High      |    jackson-databind               | java functions buildpack | 2.13.3 | The configuration `UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` is not used for deserializing data. |
| Not Affected | GHSA-rgv9-q543-rqg4 | High      |    jackson-databind               | java functions buildpack | 2.13.3 | The only configuration specified by `spring-boot-starter` is `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES`, which only affects whether it continues parsing or not.
