title: Managing Custom Stacks
owner: Build Service Team

A CustomStack is a resource that allows users to create a customized [ClusterStack](managing-stacks.html) from Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) and UBI7/UBI8 non-minimal-based OCI images.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> CustomStacks created with UBI7/UBI8 images do not currently support adding packages, mixins, or caCerts.  Currently, only the Java Tanzu Buildpacks support CustomStacks that use UBI images. </p>
<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Private registries which require a custom CA certificate are not currently supported as publishing destinations for CustomStack images.</p>

CustomStacks can be used to:

* Convert a pre-existing base image that you'd like to use with Tanzu Build Service into a ClusterStack resource.
* Add required stack metadata to base images.
* Add CA certificates to build and/or run image.
* Add packages and [mixin labels](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/stack/#mixins) to build and/or run image.
* Set CNB user and group IDs.

## <a id='creating-a-customstack'></a> Creating a CustomStack

A CustomStack is created by running `kubectl apply` with a resource configuration file. The following defines the relevant fields of the CustomStack resource spec in more detail:

* `source`: The location of base images used for building the stack. See more info in [Source Configuration](#source-config).
* `destination`: The location to publish built images and optional ClusterStack. See more info in [Destination Configuration](#destination-config).
* `caCerts`: References to config maps of CA certificates to add to one or both of the stack images.
* `packages`: List of packages to install on one or both of the stack images. A list of all available packages can be found in [Software Packages in "bionic"](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/allpackages) on the ubuntu packages web page.
* `mixins`: List of mixin labels to add to one or both of the stack images. Information on the mixins concept can be found in [Stack](https://buildpacks.io/docs/concepts/components/stack/#mixins) on the Buildpacks.io website.
* `service-account-name`: Name of service account with secret containing credentials to push to registry.
* `user`: User and group ID of the CNB user.
  * Not required if the user is already present in metadata.
  * If the user and/or group ID do not exist on the image, they are created.

### <a id='source-config'></a> Source configuration

The `source` field describes the base images for the CustomStack. It can be configured in exactly one of the following ways:

* Registry Images

  ```yaml
  source:
    registryImages:
      build:
        image: <build-base-image>
      run:
        image: <run-base-image>
  ```

  * `build-base-image`: The fully qualified reference of the build base image.
  * `run-base-image`: The fully qualified reference of the run base image.

* Stack

  ```yaml
  stack:
    name: <cluster-stack-name>
    kind: ClusterStack
  ```

  * `cluster-stack-name`: Name of ClusterStack to base CustomStack images on.

### <a id='destination-config'></a> Destination Configuration

The `destination` field describes where the built images are published and whether a ClusterStack should be created.

```yaml
destination:
  build:
    tag: <output-build-image-tag>
  run:
    tag: <output-run-image-tag>
  stack: # Optional
    name: <output-cluster-stack-name>
    kind: ClusterStack
```

* `output-build-image-tag`: The registry location where the build image is created.
* `output-run-image-tag`: The registry location where the run image is created.
* `output-cluster-stack-name`: Name of ClusterStack to create with CustomStack images.

## <a id='debugging-customstacks'></a> Debugging CustomStacks

When a CustomStack is created, a pod is created in the same namespace which modifies the base image and pushes the resulting stack image to the registry. The pod is named `stack-pod-<customstack-name>-<number>`

Where:

* `customstack-name` is the name of your CustomStack.
* `number` is the revision of your CustomStack. This is incremented by one each time a new spec is applied.

The ten latest pods are kept around for debugging purposes. To debug a failing CustomStack, check the logs of the corresponding pod: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <create-build-image/create-run-image>`

Where:

* `pod-name` is the name of the pod.
* `create-build-image/create-run-image` is the container whose logs you want to see.
	* `create-build-image` for logs related to creating the build image.
	* `create-run-image` for logs related to create the run image.
