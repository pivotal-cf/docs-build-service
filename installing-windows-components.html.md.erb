Tanzu Build Service supports building [.NET Framework](https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-buildpacks/dotnet-framework/dotnet-framework-buildpack.html)
application images. Building .NET Framework images requires a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes
provisioned.

The following features are not currently supported on Windows nodes of Tanzu Build Service:

* Caching build artifacts (which reduces the time of subsequent builds)
* Preloading ClusterBuilder images
* Using self-signed registry certificates. Use a public registry or a non-self-signed certificate.

To set up Tanzu Build Service for Windows-based builds, complete the following steps:

1. Complete the standard Tanzu Build Service installation process.

2. Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes provisioned.

3. Navigate to the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies for Microsoft Windows](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies-windows/)
in VMware Tanzu Network and accept the EULA.

4. Import the Tanzu Build Service Windows Dependencies.

    The Tanzu Build Service Windows Dependencies (Stacks, Buildpacks, Builders, etc.) are used to
    build .NET Framework applications and keep them patched. These must be imported with the `kp` cli
    and the Dependency Descriptor (`windows-descriptor-<version>.yaml`) file from the
    [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies for Microsoft Windows](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies-windows/) page.
    ```
    kp import -f /tmp/windows-descriptor-<version>.yaml
    ```
