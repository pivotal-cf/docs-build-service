Tanzu Build Service supports building [.NET Framework](https://docs.pivotal.io/tanzu-buildpacks/dotnet-framework/dotnet-framework-buildpack.html) application images. Building .NET Framework images will require a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes provisioned. 

To set up Tanzu Build Service for Windows-based builds, please follow the following steps:

1. Complete the standard Tanzu Build Service installation process.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Tanzu Build Service on Windows does not currently support self-signed registry certificates. Please use a public registry or a non-self-signed cert. </p>

2. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes provisioned. 

3. Navigate to the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies for Microsoft Windows](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies-windows/) page in Tanzu Net and accept the EULA

4. Import the Tanzu Build Service Windows Dependencies

The Tanzu Build Service Windows Dependencies (Stacks, Buildpacks, Builders, etc.) can be used to build .NET Framework applications and keep them patched. These must be imported with the `kp` cli and the Dependency Descriptor (`windows-descriptor-<version>.yaml`) file from the [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies for Microsoft Windows](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies-windows/) page:
```
kp import -f /tmp/windows-descriptor-<version>.yaml
```

The following features are not yet supported on Windows nodes of Tanzu Build Service

* Caching of build artifacts (which reduces the time of subsequent builds)
* Preloading of ClusterBuilder images
* Usage of self-signed registry certificate
