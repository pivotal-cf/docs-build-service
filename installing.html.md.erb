This topic describes how to install and configure Tanzu Build Service.

We recommend installing TBS with the Tanzu CLI and kapp controller. If you want to view the previous method of installation, see [Installing without kapp controller](installing-no-kapp.html).

Reasons to use the previous installation method include:
* You do not want to install kapp controller on your cluster
* You want to make custom changes to the TBS installation via `ytt` templating or overlays

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you install Build Service, you must:

* Be on Kubernetes cluster v1.19 or later

* Ensure that all worker nodes have at least 50 GB of ephemeral storage allocated to them.
	* To do this on TKGs, mount a 50GB volume at `/var/lib/containerd` to the worker nodes in the `TanzuKubernetesCluster` resource that corresponds to your TKGs cluster. [These instructions](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-B1034373-8C38-4FE2-9517-345BF7271A1E.html#cluster-with-separate-disks-and-storage-parameters-1) show how to configure storage on worker nodes.

* Have access to a container registry to install Tanzu Build Service and store the application images that will be created.
  * Although the documentation references specific registries for the purpose of providing examples, any registry that adheres to the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 is supported
  * If installing using the `lite` descriptor, 1GB of registry storage is recommended
  * If installing using the `full` descriptor, which is intended for production use and offline environments, 10 GB of available storage is recommended
  * This registry space suggestion does not include the space that will be used for application images built by TBS

* Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is configured with a default `StorageClass`.
Tanzu Build Service will default to using 2G of cache if a default `StorageClass` is defined.
Build Service utilizes `PersistentVolumeClaims` to cache build artifacts, which reduces the time of subsequent builds.

    For more information, see [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) in the Kubernetes documentation. And for information on defining a default StorageClass, see [Changing the default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/)

* Download Carvel [imgpkg](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/imgpkg/). Version 0.12.0 or higher is required.

* Download and install the [Tanzu CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.1/tap/GUID-install-tanzu-cli.html).
  - Only the `package` and `secret` plug-ins are required.

* Install Carvel [kapp controller](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/latest/install/) on your cluster.

* Navigate to the following pages in Tanzu Network and accept all EULAs highlighted in yellow.
  - [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/build-service/)
  - [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tbs-dependencies/)
  - [Buildpacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-buildpacks-suite)
  - [Stacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-stacks-suite)

* Find the latest Tanzu Build Service version by checking the [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/build-service/) page on Tanzu Network. Just knowing the version is sufficient.

* Download the `kp` CLI for your operating system from the [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/build-service/) page on Tanzu Network. The `kp` CLI help text is published [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/blob/v0.4.0/docs/kp.md).
	* These docs assume kp cli v0.4.* from TBS release v1.4.*. If a feature is not working, you may need to upgrade your cli.

* Download the `docker` CLI to authenticate with registries.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Clusters running with Containerd 1.4.1, 1.5.6, and 1.5.7 are not compatible with TBS. Notably, TKG 1.2.1 and TKGi 1.13.0 & 1.13.1 use these versions of Containerd, a different version must be used.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> TKGs clusters running Kubernetes 1.20.0-1.20.6 are not compatible with TBS.</p>

## <a id='install-tbs'></a> Installing Tanzu Build Service

1. Set up environment variables for use during the installation.

```
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=<IMAGE-REGISTRY>
export INSTALL_REPOSITORY=<IMAGE-REPOSITORY>
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<REGISTRY-USERNAME>
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<REGISTRY-PASSWORD>
export TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME>
export TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>
export TBS_VERSION=<LATEST-TBS-VERSION>
```

Where:

* `IMAGE-REGISTRY` is the hostname of the registry that will be used.
* `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` is the repository in your registry that you want to relocate images to.
  * Dockerhub has the form `my-dockerhub-username/build-service` or `index.docker.io/my-dockerhub-username/build-service`
  * gcr.io has the form `gcr.io/my-project/build-service`
  * Harbor has the form `my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service`
* `REGISTRY-USERNAME` is the username of the registry that will be used. You should be able to `docker push` to `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` with this credential. `gcr.io` expects `_json_key`.
* `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password of the registry that will be used. You should be able to `docker push` to `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` with this credential.
* `TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME` is the username you use to access [TanzuNet](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).
* `TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is the password you use to access [TanzuNet](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).
  * For Google Cloud Registry, use the contents of the service account JSON key.
* `LATEST-TBS-VERSION` is from the [Tanzu Network Release](https://network.pivotal.io/products/build-service/) page.

### <a id='relocate-images'></a> Relocate Images to a Registry

This procedure relocates images from the Tanzu Network registry to an internal image registry via a local machine.

The local machine must have write access to the install registry.

1. Log in to the Tanzu Network registry with your Tanzu Network credentials (`TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME` & `TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`):

```
docker login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
```

1. Log in to the image registry where you want to store the images by running:

```
docker login ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}
```

1. Copy the Tanzu Build Service package repository to your registry with the [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) tool `imgpkg` by running:

```
imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-repo=${INSTALL_REPOSITORY}
```

For example:

* Dockerhub `imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-repo=my-dockerhub-account/build-service`
* GCR `imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-repo=gcr.io/my-project/build-service`
* Artifactory `imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-repo=artifactory.com/my-project/build-service`
* Harbor `imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-repo=harbor.io/my-project/build-service`

### <a id='install'></a> Installation

1. Create a namespace called tbs-install for deploying the package by running:

```
kubectl create ns tbs-install
```

This namespace keeps the installation objects grouped together logically.

1. Add the Tanzu Build Service package repository to the cluster by running:

```
tanzu package repository add tbs-repository \
    --url "${INSTALL_REPOSITORY}:${TBS_VERSION}" \
    --namespace tbs-install
```

1. You should be able to get the status of the package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

```
tanzu package repository get tbs-repository --namespace tbs-install
```

1. Create a `tbs-values.yml` file by using the following sample as a guide. This file should be kept for future use.

```yaml
---
kp_default_repository: <INSTALL_REPOSITORY>
kp_default_repository_username: <INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME>
kp_default_repository_password: <INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>
pull_from_kp_default_repo: true
tanzunet_username: <TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME>
tanzunet_password: <TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>
descriptor_name: <DESCRIPTOR-NAME>
enable_automatic_dependency_updates: true
ca_cert_data: <CA_CERT_CONTENTS> (optional)
```

Where:

* `INSTALL_REPOSITORY` is a writable repository in your registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Same value as used during relocation.
* `INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME` is the registry username. Same value as used during relocation.
* `INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is the registry password. Same value as used during relocation.
* `TANZUNET_REGISTRY_USERNAME` is used to pull dependencies from tanzu network. Same value used during relocation
* `TANZUNET_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is used to pull dependencies from tanzu network. Same value used during relocation
* `DESCRIPTOR-NAME` is the name of the descriptor to import automatically. Available options can be found on the [Tanzu Network Build Service Dependencies](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tbs-dependencies/) page. Current available options at time of release:
  * `full` contains all dependencies - for production use.
  * `lite` smaller footprint used for speeding up installs. Requires internet access on the cluster.
* `CA_CERT_CONTENTS` *must be provided when using registry that is signed by a Custom Cert*. This should be the value of the PEM-encoded CA certificate.

#### <a id='additional-config'></a> Additional Configuration

Additional fields can be added to `tbs-values.yml`:

* `admin_users` is a comma separated list of users who will be granted admin privileges on Build Service.
* `admin_groups`: a comma separated list of groups that will be granted admin privileges on Build Service.
* `http_proxy`: The HTTP proxy to use for network traffic.
* `https_proxy`: The HTTPS proxy to use for network traffic.
* `no_proxy`: A comma-separated list of hostnames, IP addresses, or IP ranges in CIDR format that should not use a proxy.

You can see the full values schema by running:

```
tanzu package available get buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com/$TBS_VERSION --values-schema --namespace tbs-install
```

1. Install the package by running:

```
tanzu package install tbs -p buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com -v $TBS_VERSION -n tbs-install -f tbs-values.yml --poll-timeout 30m
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> >**Note:** Installing with Tanzu Network credentials automatically relocates buildpack dependencies to your registry. This install process can take some time and the `--poll-timeout` flag increases the timeout duration. Using the `lite` descriptor speeds this up significantly. If the command times out, periodically run the installation verification step provided in the following optional step. Image relocation continues in the background. </p>

### <a id='upgrade-tbs'></a> Upgrading Tanzu Build Service

To upgrade Tanzu Build Service to a newer version, run the following steps.

1. Relocate the new package repository:

```
imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$NEW_TBS_VERSION --to-repo=${INSTALL_REPOSITORY}
```

1. Add the Tanzu Build Service package repository to the cluster by running:

```
tanzu package repository add tbs-repository \
    --url "${INSTALL_REPOSITORY}:${NEW_TBS_VERSION}" \
    --namespace tbs-install
```

1. Install the package with the same `tbs-values.yml` file used during initial installation by running:

```
tanzu package install tbs -p buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com -v $NEW_TBS_VERSION -n tbs-install -f tbs-values.yml --poll-timeout 30m
```

## <a id='offline-install-tbs'></a> Installing Tanzu Build Service (Air-Gapped)

Tanzu Build Service can be installed to a Kubernetes Cluster and registry that are air-gapped from external traffic.

An air-gapped environment will often use an internal registry with a self-signed CA certificate and you will need access to this
CA certificate file to install TBS.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a CA certificate that is trusted (eg. Lets Encrypt) you will not need the CA certificate file. </p>

1. Set up environment variables for use during the installation.

```
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=<IMAGE-REGISTRY>
export INSTALL_REPOSITORY=<IMAGE-REPOSITORY>
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<REGISTRY-USERNAME>
export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<REGISTRY-PASSWORD>
export TBS_VERSION=<LATEST-TBS-VERSION>
```

Where:

* `IMAGE-REGISTRY` is the hostname of the private registry that will be used.
* `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` is the repository in your registry that you want to relocate images to.
  * Harbor has the form `my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service`
* `REGISTRY-USERNAME` is the username of the private registry that will be used. You should be able to `docker push` to `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` with this credential.
* `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password of the private registry that will be used. You should be able to `docker push` to `IMAGE-REPOSITORY` with this credential.
* `LATEST-TBS-VERSION` is from the [Tanzu Network Release](https://network.pivotal.io/products/build-service/) page.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong>The IMAGE-REPOSITORY must be the IMAGE-REGISTRY appended with the destination repository for the images.
For example, <code>IMAGE-REGISTRY/some-repo/build-service</code>.
<br>

### <a id='offline-relocate-images'></a> Relocate Images to a Registry (Air-Gapped)

This procedure relocates images from the Tanzu Network registry to an internal image registry via local machine(s).

1. Log in to the Tanzu Network registry with your Tanzu Network credentials:

```
docker login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
```

1. Copy the Tanzu Build Service package repository to your local machine as a tar with the [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) tool `imgpkg` by running:

```
imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/build-service/package-repo:$TBS_VERSION --to-tar=/tmp/tanzu-build-service.tar
```

1. Move the output file `tanzu-build-service.tar` to a machine that has access to the air-gapped environment. The machine must have write access to the internal registry.

1. Log in to the image registry where you want to store the images by running:

```
docker login ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}
```

1. Copy the images from your local machine to the internal registry:

```
imgpkg copy --tar /tmp/tanzu-build-service.tar \
  --to-repo=${INSTALL_REPOSITORY} \
  --registry-ca-cert-path <PATH-TO-CA>
```

Where:

* `PATH-TO-CA` is the path to the registry CA certificate file.

For example:

* Artifactory `imgpkg copy --tar /tmp/tanzu-build-service.tar --to-repo=artifactory.com/my-project/build-service --registry-ca-cert-path ca.crt`
* Harbor `imgpkg copy --tar /tmp/tanzu-build-service.tar --to-repo=harbor.io/my-project/build-service --registry-ca-cert-path ca.crt`

### <a id='offline-install'></a> Installation (Air-Gapped)

1. Create a namespace called `tbs-install` for deploying the package by running:

```
kubectl create ns tbs-install
```

This namespace keeps the installation objects grouped together logically.

1. Add the Tanzu Build Service package repository to the cluster by running:

```
tanzu package repository add tbs-repository \
    --url "${IMAGE-REPOSITORY}:${TBS_VERSION}" \
    --namespace tbs-install
```

1. You should be able to get the status of the package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

```
tanzu package repository get tbs-repository --namespace tbs-install
```

1. Create a `tbs-values.yml` file by using the following sample as a guide. This file should be kept for future use.

```yaml
---
kp_default_repository: $INSTALL_REPOSITORY
kp_default_repository_username: $INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME
kp_default_repository_password: $INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
pull_from_kp_default_repo: true
ca_cert_data: <CA_CERT_CONTENTS>
```

Where:

* `INSTALL_REPOSITORY` is a writable repository in your internal registry. Tanzu Build Service dependencies are written to this location. Same value as used during relocation.
* `INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME` is the internal registry username. Same value as used during relocation.
* `INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is the internal registry password. Same value as used during relocation.
* `CA_CERT_CONTENTS` *must be provided when using registry that is signed by a Custom Cert*. This should be the value of the PEM-encoded CA certificate.

#### <a id='offline-additional-config'></a> Additional Configuration

Additional fields can be added to `tbs-values.yml`.

* `admin_users` is a comma separated list of users who will be granted admin privileges on Build Service.
* `admin_groups`: a comma separated list of groups that will be granted admin privileges on Build Service.
* `http_proxy`: The HTTP proxy to use for network traffic.
* `https_proxy`: The HTTPS proxy to use for network traffic.
* `no_proxy`: A comma-separated list of hostnames, IP addresses, or IP ranges in CIDR format that should not use a proxy.

You can see the full values schema by running:

```
tanzu package available get buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com/$TBS_VERSION --values-schema --namespace tbs-install
```

1. Install the package by running:

```
tanzu package install tbs -p buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com -v $TBS_VERSION -n tbs-install -f tbs-values.yml
```

### <a id='offline-update-deps'></a> Updating Build Service Dependencies (Air-gapped)

When running in an air-gapped environment, TBS cannot pull dependencies automatically from external internet. Therefore, dependencies must be imported manually as a part of installation for TBS to work.

More, TBS dependencies must be kept up to date manually or in a CI/CD automated way in order to keep application images patched. To learn more about keeping dependencies up-to-date in an offline environment, see [Updating Build Service Dependencies](updating-deps.html#offline-update)

### <a id='offline-upgrade-tbs'></a> Upgrading Tanzu Build Service (Air-Gapped)

1. To upgrade Tanzu Build Service to a newer version in an air-gapped environment, the same relocation steps listed [here](#offline-relocate-images) must be followed with a new `TBS_VERSION`.

1. Then the same installation steps can be followed using the same `tbs-values.yml` file used for initial installation.

Re-importing dependencies is not required for upgrading TBS.

## <a id='uninstall-tbs'></a> Uninstalling Tanzu Build Service

To uninstall Tanzu Build Service, uninstall the package using the `tanzu` cli:

```
tanzu package installed delete tbs -n tbs-install -y
```

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> All Tanzu Build Service resources will be deleted. Registry images created by TBS will not be deleted. </p>

To delete the Tanzu Build Service package repository:

```
tanzu package repository delete tbs-repository --namespace tbs-install
```

## <a id='access-to-cluster-builders'></a> Ensuring Access to Cluster Builders

In order to use Cluster Builders, such as the ones installed with Tanzu Build Service, we suggest to install Tanzu Build Service to a repository that is accessible by the nodes in the kubernetes cluster without credentials.

If this is not desired, see [When to use Synchronized Secrets](synced-secrets.html#sync-secrets).

## <a id='ensure-readable-run-image'></a> Ensuring the Run Image is Readable

Build Service relies on the run-image being publicly readable or readable with the registry credentials configured in a project/namespace for the builds to be executed successfully.

The location of the run image can be identified by running the following command:

```
kp clusterstack status <stack-name>
```

If the cluster stack run image is not public, you may need to create a registry secret in any namespace where Images or Builds will be used. For more details on secrets in Tanzu Build Service, see [Managing Secrets](managing-secrets.html)

This can be done with the `kp` CLI:

```
kp secret create my-registry-creds --registry example-registry.io --registry-user my-registry-user --namespace build-namespace
```
