This topic provides an overview of Tanzu Build Service.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Tanzu Build Services helps you turn application source code into container images using a standardized flow on top of Kubernetes

Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) project for the code to  [container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/spec.md).
The standardized work flow comes from leveraging Kubernetes infrastructure with [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack), a Cloud Native Buildpacks Platform, to orchestrate the image lifecycle.
The kpack CLI tool, kp, can also aid in managing kpack resources and the automation process.
Combining these tools ensures Build Service executes reproducible builds that align with modern container standards, and additionally keeps images up-to-date.

Build Service helps you develop and automate containerized software workflows securely and at scale.

## <a id='concepts'></a> Build Service Concepts

Build Service reduces operational overhead and improves security by automating the building of application images.
It relies on `Image`, `Builder`, `ClusterStore` and `ClusterStack` to achieve these results.

### <a id='image'></a> Image

An `Image` defines the source of the application, build time environment and registry destination. This source code could reside in git, a blobstore, or as code on a workstation.

For more information see the [Managing Images and Builds](managing-images.html) page.

### <a id='builders'></a> Builder

A `Builder` references the Stack and Buildpacks that are used in the process of building source code. They "provide" the Buildpacks that run against the application and the OS images upon which the application is built and run.

For more information see the [Managing Builders](managing-builders.html) page.

### <a id='store'></a> ClusterStore

A `ClusterStore` serves as a repository for Cloud Native Buildpacks available for use in Builders. One can populate a store with Buildpacks they [create](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/) and [package](https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/package-a-buildpack).

For more information see the [Managing ClusterStores](managing-stores.html) page.

### <a id='stacks'></a> ClusterStack

A `ClusterStack` defines a pair of build and run OS images. Critical security vulnerabilities are addressed by building apps on the most up-to date stack. The stacks used by Build Service to build applications are referenced in the Builders.

For more information see the [Managing ClusterStacks](managing-stacks.html) page.
